Code me the game about this: The game is about sprinting, the viewers will choose the the player they want to be part in the sprint by sending gift, maximum of 5 players per race, I'm the one who will put players that the viewers will choose. When the sprint start, the players will run slow but if a viewer send gift the player will run fast, the bigger the amount of the gift the faster the player run. The game also let the viewers to make a certain player stumble when the certain stumble bar is low by sending gift, each gift that will make the player stumble should be unique. The process is repeated when the sprint is finished. I want it to be a web-based game using JavaScript and give instructions on what to do.
